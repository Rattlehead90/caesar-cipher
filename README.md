the Odin Project Ruby class project. 

# The gist: 
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# The approach
The problem is very straightforward and can be solved with a <i>rotation</i> around the <i>base</i> to be encodable (?) in both directions. However, it wasn't the goal of the project as the encoding would be in the right direction only. Hence, the simplistic approach of couple of <b>if</b> statements. 

# What have I learned 
Default values in methods, transforming letters to ASCII code and back, string and integer enumerables and predicative enumerables.
